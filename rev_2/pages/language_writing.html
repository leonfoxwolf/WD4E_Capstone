                        <p>At first glance, Japanese characters may seem mysterious and incomprehensible. It seems that each hieroglyph consists of jumbled lines, but in fact, each hieroglyph represents a certain picture and has a meaning associated with its content. The Japanese script contains many hieroglyphs, but fortunately not as many as is often believed in the West.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Elementary school graduates must know 881 hieroglyphs. Such a person is considered literate. A high school graduate must know 1850. To read books fluently in college, you need to remember about 3 thousand hieroglyphs. However, all these thousands of hieroglyphs are composed of less than 300 elements, or pictures, many of which are rarely used.</p>
            <p>Scientists say that until the third century BC. the Japanese did not have a written language at all (since no evidence of one was found). The Japanese had an oral language, and when they discovered that their neighbor China had not only oral, but also written language, they decided to adopt it. The Japanese took Chinese characters and began to use them to write the roots of words, but they were not suitable for grammatical endings due to the differences in languages.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the beginning, the Japanese tried to write down both the endings and roots of words with hieroglyphs. But after a few hundred years, they realized that this was very inconvenient, and then they decided to turn some hieroglyphs-bodices into simple signs of the phonetic system, like our al-favit, in order to use them to convey endings. This is how the phonetic alphabet of Kana appeared (table on the right).</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src="../img/page_language/alphabet.gif">

            </table>
            <p>Thus, written Japanese is composed of word roots (hieroglyphs) and grammatical endings (kana). Hieroglyphs are easy to distinguish from kana signs. Kana signs consist of several fairly simple lines, and hieroglyphs - from two lines or more. Kana is divided into katakana and hiragana, the former is for writing borrowed words, and the latter for grammatical endings. In the table above: the left blue hieroglyphs are katakana, the middle Russian letters are their sound (translation), and the right blue ones are hiragana.</p>
            <p>As mentioned above, each hieroglyph is a picture. Here are some fairly simple examples:</p>

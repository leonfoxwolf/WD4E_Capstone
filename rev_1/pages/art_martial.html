                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Japan is one of the few countries with a rich and distinctive martial arts tradition. Moreover, the ideals and values ​​of the warrior, his psychology and way of life over time have had a decisive influence on the character of the Japanese and the whole spirit of Japanese culture. Nowhere in the world will we find such a zealous and at the same time so ceremonious, so aesthetically perfect admiration for the courage and valor of a warrior as in Japan.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Much has been written about the martial arts in Japan, and there is no need to retell their history here. However, almost everything written on this topic repeats or at least is based on the judgments of the Japanese themselves, and these judgments are very biased in their own way, often openly tendentious. The phenomenon of Chinese culture is assessed by Japanese authors in terms of Japanese ideals, tastes and values, while the Chinese roots of Japanese martial arts are diligently hushed up or portrayed in a knowingly distorted light. There is certainly a lot in common between Chinese and Japanese martial arts, especially in matters of combat tactics. However, the differences between the Chinese and Japanese concepts of martial art are no less significant, and in a sense, even more significant.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Generally speaking, the traditional martial arts in Japan have two main sources. The first is those types of martial arts that have developed and received recognition in the dominant military class of medieval Japan, the class of the so-called <a href="art_samurai.html" style="font-size: 27px;"><i>samurai</i></a> or simply "military men" (<i>bushi</i>). Samurai were considered professional warriors who devoted their lives to military exploits, and the greatest importance among them was attached to sword fencing and archery. Since about the middle of the 14th century, these two types of weapons - especially the sword - served as the material for various theoretical constructions related to the warrior's path. The samurai were also trained in the art of hand-to-hand combat, which was known in Russia under the name of jujitsu (correctly: jujitsu).</p>

                    <td>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The second source of martial arts in Japan is the tradition of hand-to-hand fighting, or the so-called fist art (<i>kempo</i>), brought from China to the Ryukyu island, then to Okinawa, and relatively late, only in the second half of the 19th century, from there to the central regions of Japan. This art of fist fighting served as the basis for the well-known karate and other types of wrestling, in particular, aikodo and judo. In contrast to fencing and archery, kempo spread initially among commoners (who, by the way, were deprived of the right to bear arms). However, as kempo spread among the upper classes of Japanese society, it also received a solid theoretical foundation in the spirit of the samurai idea of ​​the "military path".</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">In kempo, the path of learning was described using the triad of the concepts of "following" (<i>shu</i>), "liberation" (<i>ho</i>) and "overcoming" or "withdrawal" (<i>ri</i>). In other words, at first the student had to thoroughly learn the techniques of hand-to-hand combat, then he had to learn to perform them completely freely and, finally, to surpass all external forms of combat in order to learn the secret of "fighting without confrontation".</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The social and cultural coloring of kempo was markedly different from the martial arts of the military aristocracy. In the samurai "warrior's way" the values ​​of self-control and restraint, usual for aristocratic culture, were brought to the fore. The samurai had to achieve victory through endurance and peace, so sometimes the fights of great masters were limited to gazing at the enemy: the outcome of the battle here was decided not by technique, but by willpower, the quality of the spiritual state. In the art of fist fighting, rather, the ecstatic exertion of strength and will was appreciated, which brought a feeling of complete self-realization.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">I think everyone knows where Japan is: the extension of the Kuril Archipelago down to the equator. In terms of area, "Land of the Rising Sun" occupies 377,750 km ², located on many islands. The population is 124.7 million people. Japan is separated from Central Russia by 7 time zones (the time difference is 6 hours). If you look at its location by latitudinal belts, you can see that its north is at the latitude of the Crimea, and the south is in middle Egypt! Closest neighbors: Russia, Korea, China.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Japan is shaking almost constantly, which is associated with a very violent volcanic activity. There are plenty of external formidable manifestations of this very activity - eruptions of volcanoes, mountain falls, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tsunamis. It can be seen that this determined to some extent the increased resilience, patience, dexterity, courage and tremendous efficiency of the Japanese nation and such a deeply philosophical attitude to cataclysms. The mountains give birth to many fast, cold and clean rivers and streams, which allowed them to grow the basis of life for the Japanese - their own rice. A lot of all sorts of dishes are made from it, but the main thing is, apparently, "Sushi" - rice balls of different shapes with endless variation in filling. Temperature in December: in Hokkaido (north) -2, in Okinawa (south) +12.</p>

                        <p>We should also tell about the northernmost island - Hokkaido. This island is known not only for the fact that it became part of Japan in 1869, but also for the longest and coldest winter, with an abundance of snow and ice. The economic situation of the island is not so hot, but the smart authorities of the island managed to benefit from the inconvenience - tourism. Ice and hummocks of the Sea of ​​Okhotsk - this is what the southern Japanese go to see. And from the northern mountains of the natural Daisetsuzan National Park, even with the naked eye, you can see Sakhalin Island, which, by the way, is about 20 km away.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The island of Hokkaido is somewhat like our homeland: meadows, cows, potatoes, spruce and birch trees. Unlike other islands, there are not so many cities in Hokkaido (there are only about nine of them), and besides, it has not yet been fully developed. The first settlers began to penetrate the island back in the 15th century at the initiative of one of the samurai clans - Matsumae. The government decided to join the colonization later, at the end of the 19th century, when troops were sent to the island to oust the indigenous inhabitants - the Ainu. Ainu once inhabited not only Hokkaido, but also part of the island of Honshu. In all of Japan, there are 50-60 thousand Ainu, of which about half are in Hokkaido.</p>

                        <p>In 1457, a small samurai castle of Edo was built, which in the future (and present past) was to turn into a prosperous city, and later into the capital of Japan. Having received far from Kyoto, the capital of that time, but fertile and rich lands, Ieyasu Tokugawa from the beginning of the 17th century launched colossal construction work in Edo. Tens of thousands of craftsmen covered the shallow areas of the bay, erected a majestic castle for the ruler, and built estates for the most noble families of the empire. Populous quarters of samurai, artisans, merchants, actors and courtesans arose in the city.</p>

But despite this, Tokyo still attracts more and more new residents and remains the most interesting and promising city in Japan.</p>
